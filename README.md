# CS-3451-Georgia-Tech-Computer-Graphics
This is a collection of some assignments completed in my Computer Graphics class at Georgia Institute of Technology.

The assignments I included are the more difficult/interesting ones we had to do towards the end of the semester. Each assignment was completed in Processing and used either Python or Java to complete.
